UltimateSnake
==============

A cool snake game made in pygame with a twist. By Bilal Majeed and Ivan Nesevski

Description
-----------
Ultimate Snake is a new unique experience of the classical “Snake” game for everyone, containing 2 new modes for you to try. The first mode is the normal Single player survival where you play as a snake eating food, and getting points to set a high score that you can challenge your friends with. The second mode is what we call “Snake Wars”. Here you can play against another snake, either a computer or another human player! You can have a live competition to see who can get the most points in the time limit.

Requirements
------------
You need Python 2.7 and pygame for this version. Set those programs up and just run this game by running the main.py file
